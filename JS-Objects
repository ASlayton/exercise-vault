# JS Objects

## Setup
* Create a new repo on Github called jsObjectChallenges
* Create a new folder ~/workspace/static-web/exercises/jsObjecChallenges
* Push up a README.md with the title of the repo on to master branch
* Setup branch:  make an index.html and main.js.  Index should have boilerplate and script tag.  main.js file should have console.log. You should run http-server and confirm that there are no errors and that everything is working as expected.


## Requirements
* This assignment contains 10 challenges that involve objects
* Each challenge should be done on a new branch - I should see 10 merged PRs (11 total with setup) to know you are done with this assignment
* For each challenge make a div with an id of that challenge number in the index.html.  
```
<div id="challenge-1"></div>
```
* The ouput for each challenge should be displayed in the coresponding div
* Before you merge each challenge in check that the code is properly indented and remove ALL console.logs
