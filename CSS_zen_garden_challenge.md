# The Zen Garden Challenge

## Setup

> Create a new repo on github
> Create an `exercise` branch and get working.
> Create a 'design1' folder and a 'design2' folder

## Requirements

Download the HTML and CSS files.  
:paperclip: [HTML](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index)  
:paperclip: [CSS](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css)  

Copy the contents of the HTML file into your `index.html`.  
Copy the contents of the CSS file into your `styles.css`.  

One of each of these files should go in each design folder.



Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.  Pick two designs you like and recreate them.


> The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.

> :pencil2:  In an effort to keep this project like the Zen Garden website, this exercise does not have a styles folder.
