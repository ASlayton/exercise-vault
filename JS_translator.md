# Language Translator

## Instructions

Represent a small bilingual sentence as a Javascript object (see example below) and use it to translate a holiday card message from English into another language.

`{"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":"gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"Ã¥r"}`

This is Swedish, so please choose other languages. You can add as many words/translations as you wish so that the user can write more complex holiday cards.

1. Your translator should work for 3 languages other than english
1. Your project should have one HTML file that has a textarea, buttons that have the language to translate to, and an empty DOM element into which the translated text will be inserted.
1.  The user types something in, clicks the button they want to translate to, and that language should appear in the emody DOM element.


## Style Requirements
1.  Your JS file should be comprised of functions - there should be no code that is not in a function
1.  Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentations


## Planning Requrements
1.  You should not start coding until all steps in this planning section are complete (you may push the README.md to master but no other code)
2.  Create a github project for this assignment
3.  Determine how you are going to break this assignment into different features and make a github projects card for each feature.  Each card should have the following:
      * Card Title (Example: "Create Navbar")
      * User story: (Example: "As a user, when I am on the site, there should be a navbar")
      * Dev Notes:  (Example: "Create a nav element with an li for about, projects, and blogs.  Clicking on the li should take me to a blank page with an h1 tag of that element")
      * Acceptance Criteria: (Example: "There should be a navbar, its should have 3 links, the links should work, the pages they go to should display a single h1 tag with the page title")
4.  Use a wireframe tool like [Moqups](https://moqups.com) to create wireframes for your page.
5.  Include the appropriate section of your Moqup on the github project card.

## Optional Bonus

1.  I'm Feeling Lucky
> Have an additional button that says **I'm Feeling Lucky**.  When the user clicks that button your code should randomly decide what language to translate to.

2.  Read the answer
> In addition to inserting the translated text into the HTML document, have the browser read the translated text to the user.
