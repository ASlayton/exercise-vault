# JS Arrays

## Setup
* Create a new repo called jsArrayChallenges
* Create a new folder ~/workspace/static-web/exercises/jsArrayChallenges
* Push up a README.md
* Setup:  make an index.html and main.js.  Index should have boilerplate and script tag.  main.js file should have console.log


## Requirements
* This assignment contains 10 challenges that involve arrays
* Each challenge should be done on a new branch - I should see 10 merged PRs to know you are done with this assignment
* For each challenge make a div with an id of that challenge number in the index.html.  
```
<div id="challenge-1"></div>
```
* The ouput for each challenge should be displayed in the coresponding div
* Before you merge each challenge in check that the code is properly indented and remove ALL console.logs

## Challenges

### Challenge #1: Highest Scoring Word
Given a string of 2 words, find the highest scoring word.  Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc. All letters will be lowercase there will be no punctuation.  Display (id='challenge-1') the word that is the highest scoring.  If two words score the same, display the word that appears earliest in the original string.

```
var challengeOneInput = "jumbo shrimp";  //jumbo=61, shrimp=83 should display shrimp
```

### Challenge #2: Sorting on planet Twisted-3-7

There is a planet... in a galaxy far far away. It is exactly like our planet, but it has one difference:  The values of the digits 3 and 7 are twisted. Our 3 means 7 and 7 means 3.

Write some code that takes an array of numbers and outputs an array that changes any 3s to 7s and any 7s to 3s.

```
var challengeTwoInputA = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];  //[1,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,9];
var challengeTwoInputA = [12,13,14];  //[12,17,14];
var challengeTwoInputA = [9,2,4,7,3];  //[9,2,4,3,7];
```
