## Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Connect the repository with a directory in single-page-apps/exercises
1. After pushing your base README to master, you should be working off branches
1. Create an index.html, main.js and main.css and link them all together.

## Requirements

1. Create an array of objects that represent places you've been or want to go. These objects should have a title, image and description. You need at least 5 unique objects in the array.
1. Print each of the objects to the DOM in a "card" that also has it's own input box and submit button. There should be 3 "cards" per row.
1. The final result of printing the array should look like the following mockup:



5. Create two functions:
	* writeToDom:  this function should accept a string and print it to a div with an id of my-projects
	* createProjectCards: this function should loop through the projects array and build up the html that you have on your projects page.  It should call the writeToDom function for each project.
6.  The last line of this file should be: ```createProjectCards();```

5. Create two functions:
	* writeToDom:  this function should accept a string and print it to a div with an id of my-projects
	* createBlogPosts: this function should loop through the BLOGS array and build up the html for each blog.  It should call the writeToDom function for each blog.
6.  The last line of this file should be: ```createBlogPosts();```
